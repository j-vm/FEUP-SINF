		<h1>1. Project Overview</h1>
		<p>The present document provides insights on the development process of the course project for Information Systems (SINF - EIC0040) of the Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering (MIEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).</p>
		<p>The project in question is based on a fundamental pillar: comfort for the customer. Thus, we are specifying an illustrative model of two companies, one which bottles and sells beverages and one other that sells bottles, and automating the business interaction between them with an integration with PRIMAVERA's ERP software.</p>
		<p>The aim of this project is to develop an interface that allows the companies to define a set of reactive processes that are integrated with the <em>Jasmin</em> platform: that is, processes that are executed <em>in response</em> to specific user-driven events, such as an invoice being generated or new stock being registered, and admit the concept of continuations, which define a sequence of trigger-process-stop steps within a single automated process.</p>
		<p>To achieve this goal our work is divided in two phases. In this first, planning phase, we have modeled a set of business processes between the two aforementioned companies, and have identified, developed and mocked up the core views and functionalities needed to implement our product.</p>
		<p>In this project we will use <em>Jasmin</em> to deal with all the data and processes surrounding transactions, inventory and information about each product. This information will be accessible after establishing a communication layer between <em>Jasmin</em> and the backend of our project.</p>
		<p>For the validation of the project, as said above, we will use two ficticious companies both utilizing <em>Jasmin. </em>These companies, <em>KSede</em> and <em>BottleFlip </em>interact in two key ways, as described by the BPMN diagrams present in section 4 of this report. KSede buys bottles from BottleFlip for the production of their products, various bottled beverages, and <em>BottleFlip</em> rents their factory space from<em> KSede, </em>who owns the building where they both operate.</p>
