            <strong>BeSinf</strong> is based on a fundamental pillar:{" "}
            <strong>garantee our customer's comfort</strong>. We provide a a
            service that automates the business interaction between companies
            and integrates with <strong>PRIMAVERA&#39;s ERP software</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>main aim of BeSinf</strong> is to develop an interface
            that allows companies to{" "}
            <strong>define a set of reactive processes</strong> that are
            integrated with the <strong>Jasmin platform</strong>: that is,
            processes that are executed in response to specific user-driven
            events, such as an invoice being generated or new stock being
            registered, and admit the concept of continuations, which define a
            sequence of trigger-process-stop steps within a single automated
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>BeSinf</strong> uses <strong>Jasmin</strong> to deal with
            all the data and processes surrounding transactions, inventory and
            information about each product.{" "}
